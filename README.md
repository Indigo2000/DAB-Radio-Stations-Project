# DAB-Radio-Stations-Project
Advance Programming Module project for MSc

Run the program using PyCharm (or equivalent) from main.py

Alternatively, the program can be run using Jupyter notebook from main.ipynb

The original data provided can be found in a.csv and b.csv.

The json files store the current setup of the system. When they are not present,
upon launching the program, the user will be informed that they need to import data
which can be achieved by pressing the 'Import data from csvs' button in the
main window.

The brief asked students to present a graphical user interface that would enable
a user to import data, have it cleaned and generate the specific outputs that 
can be seen in the program.
